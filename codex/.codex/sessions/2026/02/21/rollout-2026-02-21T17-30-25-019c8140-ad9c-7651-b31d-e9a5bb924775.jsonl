You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration comes through as direct, factual statements. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nYou avoid cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance, or any kind of fluff. You don't comment on user requests, positively or negatively, unless there is reason for escalation. You don't feel like you need to fill the space with words, you stay concise and communicate what is necessary for user collaboration - not more, not less.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You have 2 ways of communicating with the users:\n- Share intermediary updates in `commentary` channel. \n- After you have completed all your work, send a message to the `final` channel.\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly.\n\n## Autonomy and persistence\nPersist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible: do not stop at analysis or partial fixes; carry changes through implementation, verification, and a clear explanation of outcomes unless the user explicitly pauses or redirects you.\n\nUnless the user explicitly asks for a plan, asks a question about the code, is brainstorming potential solutions, or some other intent that makes it clear that code should not be written, assume the user wants you to make code changes or run tools to solve the user's problem. In these cases, it's bad to output your proposed solution in a message, you should go ahead and actually implement the change. If you encounter challenges or blockers, you should attempt to resolve them yourself.\n\n## Formatting rules\n\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis or em dashes unless explicitly instructed.\n\n## Final answer instructions\n\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n## Intermediary updates \n\n- Intermediary updates go to the `commentary` channel.\n- User updates are short updates while you are working, they are NOT final answers.\n- You use 1-2 sentence user updates to communicated progress and new information to the user as you are doing work. \n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- You provide user updates frequently, every 20s.\n- Before exploring or doing substantial work, you start with a user update acknowledging the request and explaining your first step. You should include your understanding of the user request and explain what you will do. Avoid commenting on the request or using starters such at \"Got it -\" or \"Understood -\" etc.\n- When exploring, e.g. searching, reading files you provide user updates as you go, every 20s, explaining what context you are gathering and what you've learned. Vary your sentence structure when providing these updates to avoid sounding repetitive - in particular, don't start each sentence the same way.\n- After you have sufficient context, and the work is substantial you provide a longer plan (this is the only user update that may be longer than 2 sentences and can contain formatting).\n- Before performing file edits of any kind, you provide updates explaining what edits you are making.\n- As you are thinking, you very frequently provide updates even if not taking any actions, informing the user of your progress. You interrupt your thinking and send multiple updates in a row if thinking for more than 100 words.\n- Tone of your updates MUST match your personality.\n"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n### Banned prefix_rules \nAvoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request [\"python3\"], [\"python\", \"-\"], or other similar prefixes.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. \n\n### Examples\nGood examples of prefixes:\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n- [\"gh\", \"pr\", \"check\"]\n- [\"pytest\"]\n- [\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n\n\n## Approved command prefixes\nThe following prefix rules have already been approved: \n The writable roots are `/home/ldr/.config`, `/tmp`, `/home/ldr/.tmp`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

In its most basic form\tit  can\n       be  used\t to  define  a\tcustom\tkey layout that persists across display\n       server boundaries (e.g wayland/X/tty).\n\n       The program runs in the foreground, printing diagnostic\tinformation  to\n       the  standard  output streams, and is intended to be run as a single in‐\n       stance managed by the init system.\n\n       NOTE:\n\n       Because keyd modifies your primary input device, it is possible to  ren‐\n       der  your  machine unusable with a bad config file. If you find yourself\n       in this situation the panic sequence  <backspace>+<escape>+<enter>  will\n       force keyd to terminate.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       Configuration  files  loosely  follow  an INI style format consisting of\n       headers of the form [section_name] followed by a set of bindings.  Lines\n       beginning with a hash are ignored.\n\n       Config files are stored in /etc/keyd/ and  loaded  upon\tinitialization.\n       The reload command can be used to update the working set of config files\n       (e.g sudo keyd reload).\n\n       A valid config file has the extension .conf and must begin with an [ids]\n       section that has one of the following forms:\n\n\t\t[ids]\n\n\t\t<id 1 (obtained via keyd monitor)>\n\t\t<id 2>\n\t\t...\n\n       or\n\n\t\t[ids]\n\n\t\t*\n\t\t-<id 1>\n\t\t-<id 2>\n\t\t...\n\n       The  first  form specifies a list of ids to be explicitly matched, while\n       the second matches any id which has not been explicitly excluded.\n\n       For example:\n\n\t\t[ids]\n\t\t*\n\t\t-0123:4567\n\n       Will match all keyboards which do not(2) have the id 0123:4567, while:\n\n\t\t[ids]\n\n\t\t0123:4567\n\n       will exclusively match any devices which do. Device ids can be  obtained\n       from  the monitor command (see COMMANDS). Note that a device id may only\n       be listed in a single config file.\n\n       Each subsequent section of the file corresponds to a layer (with the ex‐\n       ception of [global] (see GLOBALS).\n\n       Config errors will appear in the log output and can be accessed\tin  the\n       usual  way  using your system's service manager (e.g sudo journalctl -eu\n       keyd).\n\n       If an id matches more than one device type, the prefix k: may be used to\n       exclusively match keyboards and the prefix m: may be used to exclusively\n       match mice. (E.g m:046d:b01d)\n\n       Note: All keyboards defined within a given config file  will  share  the\n       same  state.  This is useful for linking separate input devices together\n       (e.g foot pedals).\n\n       Note 2: The wildcard will only match devices which  keyd\t identifies  as\n       keyboards.  keyd\t is  also  capable  of managing mice (e.g to facilitate\n       clearing of oneshot modifiers on click), but their ids must  be\texplic‐\n       itly listed.\n\n       Note  3: Mouse support is currently experimental, and is mostly confined\n       to traditional mice (e.g touchpads). Adding some mice to your  ids  sec‐\n       tion  may  break\t your  pointer.\t It may also be necessary to explicitly\n       blacklist mice which are misidentified as keyboards  (e.g  if  you  find\n       your moused misbehaving).\n\n   Layers\n       A  layer is a collection of bindings, each of which specifies the behav‐\n       iour of a particular key. Multiple layers may be\t active\t at  any  given\n       time,  forming  a stack of occluding keymaps consulted in activation or‐\n       der. The default layer is called\t main  and  is\twhere  common  bindings\n       should be defined.\n\n       For example, the following config snippet defines a layer called nav and\n       creates a toggle for it in the main layer:\n\n\t\t[main]\n\n\t\tcapslock = layer(nav)\n\n\t\t[nav]\n\n\t\th = left\n\t\tk = up\n\t\tj = down\n\t\tl = right\n\n       When  capslock  is  held,  the nav layer occludes the main layer causing\n       hjkl to function as the corresponding arrow keys.\n\n       Unlike most other remapping tools, keyd provides first class support for\n       modifiers. A layer name may optionally end with a ':' followed by a  set\n       of  modifiers  to  emulate  in the absence of an explicit mapping. Layer\n       names may consist of a maximum of 64  characters\t (including  all  modi‐\n       fiers).\n\n       These  layers  play  nicely  with  other modifiers and preserve existing\n       stacking semantics.\n\n       For example:\n\n\t\t[main]\n\n\t\tcapslock = layer(capslock)\n\n\t\t[capslock:C]\n\n\t\tj = down\n\n       will cause capslock to behave as control, except in  the\t case  of  cap‐\n       slock+j,\t which\twill  emit down. This makes it trivial to define custom\n       modifiers which don't interfere with one another.\n\n       Note that bindings are not affected by the modifiers  of\t the  layer  in\n       which  they are defined. Thus capslock+j will produce an unmodified down\n       keypress, while shift+capslock+j will produce shift+down as expected.\n\n       Formally, each layer heading has the following form:\n\n\t\t\"[\" <layer name>[:<modifier set>] \"]\"\n\n       Where <modifier_set> has the form:\n\n\t   <modifier1>[-<modifier2>]...\n\n       and each modifier is one of:\n\n\t   C - Control\n\t   M - Meta/Super\n\t   A - Alt\n\t   S - Shift\n\t   G - AltGr\n\n       Finally, each layer heading is followed by a set of bindings which  take\n       the form:\n\n\t   <key> | <alias> = <key>|<macro>|<action>\n\n       for a description of <action> and <macro> see ACTIONS and MACROS.\n\n       By  default,  each key is bound to itself within the main layer. The ex‐\n       ception to this are the modifier keys, which are instead bound to epony‐\n       mously named layers with the corresponding modifiers.\n\n       For example, meta is actually bound to layer(meta), where meta is inter‐\n       nally defined as meta:M.\n\n       The full set of modifier bindings are as follows:\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

In order to achieve satisfactory\nresults a medley of tools need to be employed (e.g xcape, xmodmap) with the end\nresult often being tethered to a specified environment (X11). keyd attempts to\nsolve this problem by providing a flexible system wide daemon which remaps keys\nusing kernel level input primitives (evdev, uinput).\n\n# Note on v2\n\nThe config format has undergone several iterations since the first\nrelease. For those migrating their configs from v1 it is best\nto reread the [man page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvaiya/keyd/refs/heads/master/docs/keyd.scdoc) (`man keyd`).\n\nSee also: [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n# Goals\n\n  - Speed       (a hand tuned input loop written in C that takes <<1ms)\n  - Simplicity  (a [config format](#sample-config) that is intuitive)\n  - Consistency (modifiers that [play nicely with layers](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd/blob/6dc2d5c4ea76802fd192b143bdd53b1787fd6deb/docs/keyd.scdoc#L128) by default)\n  - Modularity  (a UNIXy core extensible through the use of an [IPC](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd/blob/90973686723522c2e44d8e90bb3508a6da625a20/docs/keyd.scdoc#L391) mechanism)\n\n# Features\n\nkeyd has several unique features many of which are traditionally only\nfound in custom keyboard firmware like [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)\nas well as some which are unique to keyd.\n\nSome of the more interesting ones include:\n\n- Layers (with support for [hybrid modifiers](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd/blob/6dc2d5c4ea76802fd192b143bdd53b1787fd6deb/docs/keyd.scdoc#L128)).\n- Key overloading (different behaviour on tap/hold).\n- Keyboard specific configuration.\n- Instantaneous remapping (no more flashing :)).\n- A client-server model that facilitates scripting and display server agnostic application remapping. (Currently ships with support for X, sway, and gnome (wayland)).\n- System wide config (works in a VT).\n- First class support for modifier overloading.\n- Unicode support.\n\n### keyd is for people who:\n\n - Would like to experiment with custom [layers](https://docs.qmk.fm/feature_layers) (i.e custom shift keys)\n   and oneshot modifiers.\n - Want to have multiple keyboards with different layouts on the same machine.\n - Want to be able to remap `C-1` without breaking modifier semantics.\n - Want a keyboard config format which is easy to grok.\n - Like tiny daemons that adhere to the Unix philosophy.\n - Want to put the control and escape keys where God intended.\n - Wish to be able to switch to a VT to debug something without breaking their keymap.\n\n### What keyd isn't:\n\n - A tool for programming individual key up/down events.\n\n# Dependencies\n\n - Your favourite C compiler\n - Linux kernel headers (already present on most systems)\n\n## Optional\n\n - python      (for application specific remapping)\n - python-xlib (only for X support)\n - dbus-python (only for KDE support)\n\n# Installation\n\n*Note:* master serves as the development branch, things may occasionally break\nbetween releases. Releases are [tagged](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd/tags), and should be considered stable.\n\n## From Source\n\n    git clone https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd\n    cd keyd\n    make && sudo make install\n    sudo systemctl enable --now keyd\n\n# Quickstart\n\n1. Install and start keyd (e.g `sudo systemctl enable keyd --now`)\n\n2. Put the following in `/etc/keyd/default.conf`:\n\n```\n[ids]\n\n*\n\n[main]\n\n# Maps capslock to escape when pressed and control when held.\ncapslock = overload(control, esc)\n\n# Remaps the escape key to capslock\nesc = capslock\n```\n\nKey names can be obtained by using the `keyd monitor` command. Note that while keyd is running, the output of this\ncommand will correspond to keyd's output. The original input events can be seen by first stopping keyd and then\nrunning the command. See the man page for more details.\n\n3. Run `sudo keyd reload` to reload the config set.\n\n4. See the man page (`man keyd`) for a more comprehensive description.\n\nConfig errors will appear in the log output and can be accessed in the usual\nway using your system's service manager (e.g `sudo journalctl -eu keyd`).\n\n*Note*: It is possible to render your machine unusable with a bad config file.\nShould you find yourself in this position, the special key sequence\n`backspace+escape+enter` should cause keyd to terminate.\n\nSome mice (e.g the Logitech MX Master) are capable of emitting keys and\nare consequently matched by the wildcard id. It may be necessary to\nexplicitly blacklist these.\n\n## Application Specific Remapping (experimental)\n\n- Add yourself to the keyd group:\n\n\t`usermod -aG keyd <user>`\n\n- Populate `~/.config/keyd/app.conf`:\n\nE.G\n\n\t[alacritty]\n\n\talt.] = macro(C-g n)\n\talt.[ = macro(C-g p)\n\n\t[chromium]\n\n\talt.[ = C-S-tab\n\talt.] = macro(C-tab)\n\n- Run:\n\n\t`keyd-application-mapper`\n\nYou will probably want to put `keyd-application-mapper -d` somewhere in your \ndisplay server initialization logic (e.g ~/.xinitrc) unless you are running Gnome.\n\nSee the man page for more details.\n\n## SBC support\n\nExperimental support for single board computers (SBCs) via usb-gadget\nhas been added courtesy of Giorgi Chavchanidze.\n\nSee [usb-gadget.md](src/vkbd/usb-gadget.md) for details.\n\n## Packages\n\nThird-party packages exist for some distributions.

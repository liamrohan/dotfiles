As you add code, keep a clear, conventional layout:\n+- `src/` for implementation code.\n+- `tests/` for automated tests.\n+- `assets/` for non-code artifacts (fixtures, sample data).\n+- `docs/` for design notes and references.\n+Update this document once the structure stabilizes.\n+\n+## Build, Test, and Development Commands\n+No build or test commands are defined yet. When you introduce tooling, add explicit commands here, for example:\n+- `make build` to compile or package.\n+- `make test` or `npm test` to run the test suite.\n+- `make lint` to run formatting or static analysis.\n+Prefer a single entrypoint (e.g., `Makefile` or `taskfile`) to keep contributors aligned.\n+\n+## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n+Define style rules alongside the first code additions. Recommended defaults:\n+- Indentation: 2 spaces for JS/TS, 4 spaces for Python, tabs only when required by tooling.\n+- Naming: `snake_case` for files in Python, `kebab-case` for docs, `PascalCase` for types/classes.\n+- Formatting: add a formatter (e.g., `prettier`, `gofmt`, `black`) and document the command.\n+\n+## Testing Guidelines\n+No test framework is configured yet. When adding tests:\n+- Choose a single framework per language (e.g., `pytest`, `go test`, `vitest`).\n+- Name tests with a clear pattern (e.g., `test_*.py`, `*.spec.ts`).\n+- Keep fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` when needed.\n+\n+## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n+No commit history is available to infer conventions. Until a standard emerges:\n+- Use concise, imperative commit messages (e.g., `Add parser prototype`).\n+- PRs should include a clear description, linked issue (if any), and test evidence.\n+\n+## Agent-Specific Notes\n+If you add automation (linters, formatters, CI), document exact commands and required versions here.\n*** End Patch"}}
